	<h1>Architecture</h1>
<p>Contiv Storage consists of a suite of four components:</p>
<p>The <code>volplugin</code> process is a plugin process that manages the lifecycle of volume mounts on
specific hosts and local create, read, update delete (CRUD) operations and runtime parameter
management.</p>
<p>The <code>apiserver</code> process is the API service. It exists to give <code>volcli</code> a way to
coordinate with the cluster at large.  It store state with the <code>etcd</code> service.</p>
<p>The <code>volcli</code> utility manages the <code>apiserver</code>'s data. It both makes REST calls
into <code>apiserver</code> and additionally can write directly to etcd.</p>
<p>The <code>volsupervisor</code> service handles scheduled and supervised tasks such as snapshotting.</p>

<h2>Organizational Architecture</h2>
<p>The <code>apiserver</code> process can be installed anywhere it is able to contact <code>etcd</code>, 
and must be reachable by <code>volcli</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>volsupervisor</code> service must only be deployed on one host at a time.</p>
<p>The <code>volplugin</code> component must run on every host that runs containers. On
startup, it creates a UNIX socket in the appropriate plugin path so that
Docker recognizes it. This creates a driver named <code>volplugin</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>volcli</code> utility is a management tool and can be run anywhere that has access to 
the <code>etcd</code> cluster and <code>apiserver</code>.</p>

<h2>Security Architecture</h2>
<p>There is none currently. This is still an alpha, security will be a beta
target.</p>

<h2>Network Architecture</h2>
<p>The <code>apiserver</code>, by default, listens on <code>0.0.0.0:9005</code>. It provides a REST
interface used both by <code>volplugin</code> and <code>volcli</code>. It connects to <code>etcd</code> at <code>127.0.0.1:2379</code>.
You can change the <code>etcd</code> address and port by supplying <code>--etcd</code> one or more times.</p>
<p>The <code>volsupervisor</code> service needs root access, a connection to <code>etcd</code>, and access to 
ceph <code>rbd</code> tools as <em>admin</em>.</p>
<p>The <code>volplugin</code> component listens on no network ports (it uses a UNIX socket, as described
above, to connect to Docker). It connects to <code>etcd</code> at <code>127.0.0.1:2379</code>. You can
can change the <code>etcd</code> address and port by supplying <code>--etcd</code> one or more times.</p>
<p>The <code>volcli</code> utility connects to <code>apiserver</code> and <code>etcd</code> to communicate various state and
operations to the system.</p>
