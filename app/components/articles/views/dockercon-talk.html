    <h1>Dockercon'16 - Enabling Container Applications in Production - Now Online</h1>
    <p><em> By Balaji Sivasubramanian On July 2016 </em></p>

    <p>4000 attendees at Dockercon last month was a great proof that more and more customers are considering containers and microservices architecture for future cloud native applications. I was there along with rest of the Contiv team talking about how Contiv provide ability to specify and enforce run time container application characteristics to allow for predictable performance in a shared enterprise infrastructure. We are extremely happy with the response and follow-up from the attendees. If you missed my talk, you can find it below.
